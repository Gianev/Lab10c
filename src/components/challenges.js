import React from 'react'

function challenges() {
  return (
    <div>
        <h>Challenges</h>
        <p>
        The challenges I faced was mainly finding a place to host the code. I was not sure where to host for free.
         However I remembered about github pages which offers a way to host static pages for free, including react, which was perfect for this assignment.
        </p></div>

}

export default challenges
