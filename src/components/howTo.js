        <p>
        I installed this framework by first installing node.js straight from their website. 
        Then I opened my CMD and ran in a folder i had made for the project npx create-react-app. 
        Once that is done i opened my editor, visual studio code and removed evrything in the src folder except 
        app.js, index.js and index.css because these are the main things you need for the website. I then made a components folder 
        to store my components which are the paragraphs I am writing in. This is not necessary but it is a way to put reusable components
         that can be used in the future. I also installed some extentions that give me access to the rfce short cut which auto creates boiler
         plate for react components. Once i finished my components I imported them and added them into App.js to be displayed.
    </p></div>
